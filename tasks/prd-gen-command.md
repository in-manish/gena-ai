# Product Requirements Document: `gen` Command for AI Q&A in Terminal

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document describes a feature for a terminal command (`gen`) that enables users to ask natural language questions and receive AI-generated answers directly in the terminal. The goal is to provide a simple, intuitive way for users to query an AI model (such as Gemini or ChatGPT) for information, explanations, or quick facts without leaving the command line.

## 2. Goals

- Allow users to ask general or technical questions from the terminal using a simple command.
- Display clear, concise AI-generated answers in the terminal.
- Support a wide range of question types (e.g., factual, code-related, general knowledge).
- Integrate with existing AI provider configuration (Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.).

## 3. User Stories

- As a developer, I want to type `gen 'what is today\'s date?'` and get the current date as an answer in my terminal.
- As a user, I want to ask general knowledge questions (e.g., `gen 'who is the president of France?'`) and get a direct answer.
- As a technical user, I want to ask for code explanations or summaries (e.g., `gen 'explain this Python code: ...'`).

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. The system must provide a terminal command (`gen`) that accepts a natural language question as an argument.
2. The system must send the question to the configured AI provider (Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.) and display the answer in the terminal.
3. The system must support both single-line and multi-line answers.
4. The system must handle errors gracefully (e.g., if the AI service is unavailable, display a clear error message).
5. The system must use the same API key and model configuration as the main CLI agent.
6. The system should allow users to specify a different model for a single query (e.g., `gen --model chatgpt 'question'`).
7. The system should output plain text by default, but may support minimal styling (e.g., bold question, colored answer) in the future.
8. The system should not execute any code or commands returned by the AIâ€”answers are for informational purposes only.
9. The system should provide a help flag (`gen --help`) to explain usage.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- The command will not execute or run any code/scripts returned by the AI.
- The command will not access or modify local files or system data (unless explicitly extended in the future).
- The command will not provide a GUI or web interface.
- The command will not store user questions or answers.

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)

- The command should be as fast and responsive as possible.
- Output should be readable in all major terminal emulators.
- Future enhancements may include output formatting, clipboard integration, or saving answers to a file.

## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)

- Should reuse the existing AI provider abstraction and configuration from the CLI agent.
- Should be implemented as a subcommand or alias within the existing CLI agent, or as a standalone script.
- Should handle API rate limits and errors gracefully.

## 8. Success Metrics

- Users can successfully ask questions and receive answers in the terminal.
- High user satisfaction and adoption (measured by feedback or usage stats).
- Low error rate in AI interactions.

## 9. Open Questions

- Should the `gen` command support piping input or only direct arguments?
- Should answers be cached for repeated questions?
- Should there be an option to copy answers to clipboard or save to a file?
- Should the command support additional output formats (e.g., markdown, JSON)?

---

**Assumptions:**
- The primary user is a developer or technical user comfortable with the terminal.
- The feature will use the same AI provider and configuration as the main CLI agent.
- The command will be informational only and will not execute any returned code.

**Next Steps:**
- Review and refine open questions and assumptions.
- Gather user feedback for further clarification and prioritization.
