# Product Requirements Document: CLI AI Agent

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a Command Line Interface (CLI) agent that leverages AI models (such as Gemini, ChatGPT, or similar) to provide intelligent, context-aware command suggestions and code completions. The goal is to create a tool similar to codex-cli, enabling users to receive predictive command suggestions, explanations, and code snippets directly in their terminal, thereby improving productivity and reducing errors.

## 2. Goals

- Enable users to receive AI-powered command suggestions based on their current terminal context.
- Support multiple AI models (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT) with easy configuration.
- Provide context-aware completions, explanations, and code snippets.
- Ensure a seamless and intuitive CLI experience.

## 3. User Stories

- As a developer, I want the CLI agent to suggest the next command based on my current directory and command history so that I can work faster and avoid mistakes.
- As a user, I want to choose between different AI models (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT) for suggestions, depending on my preferences or API access.
- As a new terminal user, I want the agent to explain suggested commands so I can learn as I work.
- As a power user, I want to configure the agent to use my own API keys and model preferences.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. The system must allow users to invoke the CLI agent from the terminal (e.g., via a command like `ai-cli`).
2. The system must accept user input (e.g., partial commands, questions, or requests for suggestions).
3. The system must provide context-aware command suggestions based on:
    - Current working directory
    - Command history
    - Project files (optional, if permitted)
4. The system must support multiple AI models (e.g., Gemini, ChatGPT) and allow users to select or configure the model.
5. The system must display AI-generated suggestions, explanations, or code snippets in the terminal.
6. The system must allow users to accept, modify, or ignore suggestions.
7. The system must provide clear error messages for failed API calls or unsupported commands.
8. The system must allow users to configure API keys and model preferences securely.
9. The system must not execute any suggested command automatically without explicit user confirmation.
10. The system should log interactions for debugging and improvement (with user consent).

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- The agent will not execute commands automatically without user approval.
- The agent will not provide a graphical user interface (GUI).
- The agent will not store or transmit user data without consent.
- The agent will not support offline AI models in the initial version (cloud-based only).

## 6. Design Considerations (Optional)

- The CLI should have a minimal, non-intrusive interface, similar to popular CLI tools.
- Suggestions could be shown inline or as a list after the user presses a specific key (e.g., Tab or Enter).
- Should follow accessibility and usability best practices for terminal applications.

## 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)

- Should be implemented in a language suitable for CLI tools (e.g., Python, Node.js, Go).
- Must handle API rate limits and errors gracefully.
- Should be extensible to support additional AI models in the future.
- Should use environment variables or a config file for API keys.

## 8. Success Metrics

- Users report increased productivity and satisfaction (via feedback or surveys).
- High accuracy of command suggestions (measured by user acceptance rate).
- Low error rate in API interactions.
- Adoption by target user base (e.g., number of installs or active users).

## 9. Open Questions

- Should the agent have access to project files for deeper context, or only use command history and current directory?
- What is the preferred language for implementation?
- Should the agent support offline/local models in the future?
- Are there any privacy or security concerns regarding command history or project data?
- What is the minimum set of AI models to support at launch?
- Should the agent provide explanations for all suggestions by default, or only on request?

**Assumptions:**
- The primary user is a developer or technical user familiar with the terminal.
- The agent will be cloud-based initially, with support for Gemini and ChatGPT models.
- User data will be handled securely and only with consent.

**Next Steps:**
- Review and refine open questions and assumptions.
- Gather user feedback for further clarification and prioritization.
